# PhD Protocol
## Title pending

This repository contains the ongoing work for my PhD protocol in Physics, focused on two main Multiple Scattering Theories and its Applications in Biosensing . 
  
## Research Objectives
1. Numerical implementation of the CSM and TFT considering size distribution
2. Implementation of a parameter fitting method
3. Comparison and evaluation of measurement schemes with the CSM
